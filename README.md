It's not about WHY?, it's about WHY NOT! Don't expect any reproducable and useful code


# [Putting destructor into Python's class constructor](https://github.com/skelly37/funny-experiments/blob/main/constructor-destructor.py)
### Idea:
I wanted to create fancy data validation â€” ifs and exceptions are lame and boring :) 
### Solution:
Just use weak references from built-in `weakref` module! Weakref is able to kill itself, so you can destroy all the references and free up the memory. Very dirty hack, don't use it, kids :)

### Output:
`Destroying itself... FF`

`Destroying itself... BB`

`Traceback (most recent call last):`

`  File "/data/temp/./constructor-destructor.py", line 27, in <module>`

`    bar.say_something(11)`

`ReferenceError: weakly-referenced object no longer exists`

# NOTE
I can't say it's fully my approach. It's just my ideas, my code refactoring, my ability to search, copy and paste AND OBVIOUSLY the community!
